Hey Paddock!

My name is Luke, I am one of your happy customers (I rented a McLaren 540c from you a few years ago) but also a web developer who has specialised in e-commerce for the past 5 years. Redesigning, building and maintaining websites for global retailers like PUMA and LEGO.

I have been looking at applying the tools, technologies and templates that I've accrued over the years to smaller businesses, in order to help improve their online presence and drive more sales.

Your company seemed like a perfect candidate for this kind of overhaul, so over the past week I have taken the time to redesign and rebuild your existing website from scratch. You can take a the deployed prototype by clicking on the link below.

This is not just a website however, this is a complete business management solution; with an admin panel that allows you to manage content, inventory, bookings, and customer interactions all in one place.

See the video below demonstrating how and what happens when a customer makes a booking on the website:

If you think that this is something you would be interested in learning more about then please let me know and I can give you a tour of the system.
